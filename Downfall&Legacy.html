<p>While it seems that Capone was thriving and still untouched by law, things would begin to change. Law enforcement would begin to take a different tactic and work with the IRS. On June 5, 1931, Capone was indicted for 22 counts of federal income tax evasion for the years 1925 through 1929. On June 12th, he and others were charged with conspiracy to violate Prohibition laws for the years 1992 to 1931. After all Capone did and got away with, tax evasion would be the thing that took him down. In October 1931, Al Capone was found guilty and sentenced to 11 years in prison.</p>

<p>In 1932, Capone entered <strong>Atlanta penitentiary</strong> but was later on transferred to the new <strong>Alcatraz prison</strong> in August 1934. 
While serving his sentence, his illness grew worse. He had contracted syphilis, to which he was too ashamed to seek medical attention for, and his illness, left unchecked, worsened. In 1939, he was paroled early due to bad health, and he did not return to Chicago; rather, he went to Florida and stayed at his mansion there with his loyal wife, Mae, and their son, Sonny. The last years of his life consisted of good and bad days, living life as a patient, mostly staying home with the occasional appearance out in public, but on January 25, 1947, Al Capone died of Syphilis at the age of 48.</p>
<br>
 <p>To this day, Al Capone is regarded as a legend and icon in the world of gangsters, a man who rose from a nobody in Brooklyn to the most feared and powerful crime boss in Chicago.</p>

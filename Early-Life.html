<hr>
<p><Strong>Alphonese "Al" Gabriel Capone</Strong> was born to a poor immigrant family in Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York, on January 17, 1899. He struggled in school. Once a good student, he began falling behind and had to repeat the sixth grade, and eventually started skipping school to hang out at the Brooklyn docks. By the age of 14, he was expelled for hitting a female teacher and never returned. His family later moved to a better home on the outskirts of Park Slope, Brooklyn, exposing Capone to wider cultural influences and giving him more opportunities to explore the world of crime. </p>
<p>Throughout his late teens (1915 to 1917), Capone became involved in Brooklyn street gangs, doing small-time criminal work and joining the <strong>James Street Boys</strong>, which was run by <strong>Johnny Torrio</strong>, a "gentleman gangster." <img src="images/Johnny Torrio.jpeg" alt="Johnny Torrio" class="johnny-torrio" width="300" height="300"> This is where he first connected with Torrio, who recognized Capone's potential and began mentoring him. Around the same time, Capone also worked as a bouncer for a Coney Island crime boss, <strong>Frankie Yale</strong>, at the "Harvard Inn," a nightclub that may also have operated as a brothel. During this period, Capone got into an altercation with a customer after making a pass at the customer's sister. The brother attacked him with a knife, leaving Capone with permanent scars on his face. This incident earned him the nickname <strong>"Scarface"</strong>, which he came to despise. Around the same time, he gained another nickname, <strong>"Snorky"</strong>, Italian slang meaning elegant, referring to his hulky yet stylish appearance. Yale recognized Capone's brains and toughness, and he quickly rose through the ranks of the Yale organization.</p>

<p>In 1918, Capone married <strong>Mary "Mae" Josephine Coughlin</strong>, an Irish Catholic woman whom he met about a year earlier at a party in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood. Their marriage may have been arranged by Capone's mother, who knew Mae from church. The exact details of how the two met remain unclear, yet Mary became pregnant with their first and only child, a son,<strong>"Sonny"</strong>, and shortly got married in December 1918. </p>
<p>By 1919, Capone had already killed at least one man, who had just won a neighborhood craps game. Capone shot the man and robbed him of his winnings, and despite being questioned by the police, Capone was let go due to no witnesses. In another incident, Capone brutally assaulted a low-level member of the White Hand gang and left him for dead. Capone had also roughed up plenty of others. This left Capone with a victim seeking revenge, and Yale would send Capone, his wife, and his young son to Chicago to work for Torrio. Capone's reputation and power would only begin to grow more.</p>
